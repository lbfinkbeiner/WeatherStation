# WeatherStation

The library requirements for this program are matplotlib and numpy.

To run the weather station monitor, navigate to the installation directory and try

`python3 weather_report.py`

Keep in mind that there is currently a bug with the TKInter integration, so you may have to ^C and try again.

"objectives.txt" is essentially a local to-do file that I maintain for personal convenience.
