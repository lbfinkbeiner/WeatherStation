The goal is to program a weather station readout with
easy touch-screen access

Don't forget to revert from Dvorak to QWERTY once you are done programming.

Also before we pass the torch, we should ask Alex how to handle
the under-volting. It could slowly damage the SD card over time.

Next steps:
	I. Split the output into pages:
		1. Weather station 1
		2. Weather station 2
		3. Differences
		4. Graphs
			This seems tough. There's not a whole lot
			of screen space but there are A LOT of graphs
			that I want to do (multiplied by three since
			we have counterpart graphs across all three pages)

Things I'm thinking about:
* How do I want to represent wind direction?
	Maybe we can have a vector arrow spinning around,
	then we have a separate graph for the intensities

Things I'm asking about:
* How long of a running average does Alex want for the plots?
	The readouts are already aggregations. It might be kind of
	strange or even misleading to aggregate aggregates.
* Until I ask this question, it might be best to give the user
    some options, like 5, 10, 50, 100

Things I could try to research for myself (documentation) or I could ask:
* How does the weather station give minima, maxima, and averages?
	I mean, what are the intervals over which those aggregations are
	given?

Based on some preliminary research, it seems like Tkinter is the
go-to library for Python GUI programming. But I will have something
of a learning curve, of course.

Things I know I need to do:
* Make the buttons much larger. Remember that any user interaction
	is going to be through that 3.5" touch screen.
* The program should automatically dump variable values into a CSV file
* Then we can keep logs for the weather of each day.
